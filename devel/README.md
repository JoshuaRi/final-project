You can say "loan" to get money from the bank up to one thousand you will not need to pay it back but you will not be able to get anymore loans. You can invest, there are secure investments that have a 80% chance of passing but only give about 20% above what you invested and risk investments which are 20% chance to pass but double your money. When you recieve a investment it will go under income, whenever you type skip you will go to the next month and the income will be added to your total. The goal is to get as much money as possible before month 40.
