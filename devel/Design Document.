At the start of my project, I did not know what to specifically implement, as I thought of it I simplified it. So I thought of different
kinds of investments such as "risk" and "secure" where risk will have more payoff but will of course be more riskier. As well as the idea
of loans my initial plan seemed to complicated so I made it more simple by just having a max amount you can loan, with no need to actually
pay back in return. The original goal was to keep your money until a certain amount of days which I put to "40 months" which seems like
a good amount of time for a quick game.
